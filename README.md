## Blockcnain 
This Python project implements a basic blockchain network using Flask to provide a web API.
- **Proof of Work:** Implements a simple Proof of Work algorithm to secure the blockchain by requiring computational effort to mine blocks.
- **Consensus:** Provides a basic consensus mechanism to resolve conflicts between different nodes, ensuring the longest valid chain is adopted.
- **Transactions:** Allows users to create and record transactions, which are added to blocks on the blockchain.
- **Mining:** Enables nodes to mine new blocks, validate transactions, and receive rewards.
- **API:** Offers a RESTful API for interacting with the blockchain, including endpoints for mining new blocks, creating transactions, registering nodes, and retrieving the blockchain state.

### How to Run
Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-python.git
cd blockchain-python
```
Install the dependencies (ensure you have Python 3.x installed):

```
pip install Flask requests
```
Run the application:
```
python your_blockchain_file.py
```
### Future Enhancements
- Add more complex validation for transactions and nodes.
- Implement a more advanced Proof of Work or replace it with Proof of Stake.
- Add a frontend interface to interact with the blockchain.
Integrate wallets for managing addresses and private keys.
